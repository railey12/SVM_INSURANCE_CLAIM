# SVM_INSURANCE_CLAIM

The objective of this project is to apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) binary
classification techniques on a car insurance claim dataset to predict whether a customer
will file an insurance claim based on given features. 

This project will cover basic exploratory data analysis, data visualization, data preprocessing, model evaluation,
and parameter tuning for the SVM model.
